Camera Network is a camera sensor project developped with ROS (Robotic Operating System) to communicate easily with multiple camera device on the network.

For now, Camera Network is compatible with gphoto and the picamera module.

You can communicate with the network directly with ROS, or with the WebGUI (if the master-server is launched with the right webserver url)
